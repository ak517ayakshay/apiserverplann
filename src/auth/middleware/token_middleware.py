"""
Token middleware for authentication.

This file will implement the token authentication middleware.
It will be used to protect routes that require authentication.

Functions to implement:
- token_auth: Validate token from Authorization header and extract provider ID
- validate_token_payload: Validate token payload structure and expiration
- handle_auth_exceptions: Handle authentication exceptions with appropriate responses

This middleware will be used across all modules that require authentication,
ensuring consistent authentication behavior throughout the API.
