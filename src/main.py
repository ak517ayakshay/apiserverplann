"""
Main application entry point for the API server.

This file will be updated to use the new modular structure.
It will import and register all routers from the subcategories.

Changes to implement:
1. Import routers from all subcategories:
   - APC module: auth, member_management, actions, vitals, reports, clinical, annotations, external_events, visualization
   - Member module: profile, vitals, auth, dashboards, feedback, summary, actions
   - Internal module: provider_management, analytics, logging, reports
   - Auth module: middleware (for token_auth)

2. Register routers with appropriate prefixes:
   - APC routers with '/apc' prefix
   - Member routers with '/member' prefix
   - Internal routers with '/internal' prefix

3. Apply middleware and security:
   - CORS middleware
   - Authentication middleware
   - Logging middleware
   - APM middleware

This modular approach will make the codebase more maintainable and easier to extend.
Each endpoint will be properly categorized, and business logic will be separated from route definitions.
