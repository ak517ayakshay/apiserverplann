"""
External events router for the APC API.

This file will define the routes for external events endpoints within the APC module.
The actual business logic will be implemented in the corresponding service file.

Routes to implement:
- POST /apc/external_events/create_events: Create one or more external events
- POST /apc/external_events/get_events: Get external events based on matching criteria
- GET /apc/external_events/create_event_from_plain_description: Create an external event from plain text

This router will be registered with the '/apc' prefix in the main application.
