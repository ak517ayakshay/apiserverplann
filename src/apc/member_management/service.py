"""
Member management service for the APC API.

This file will implement the business logic for member management endpoints within the APC module.
The actual implementation will be moved here from the original router.py file.

Functions to implement:
- apc_member_add: Add a new member to the provider
- apc_member_update: Update member information
- get_member_data: Get member information by ID, email, or phone number

This service will handle all business logic related to member management operations performed by providers,
including data validation, storage, retrieval, and modification.
