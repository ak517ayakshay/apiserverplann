Annotations service for the APC API.

This file will implement the business logic for annotation-related endpoints within the APC module.
The actual implementation will be moved here from the original router.py file.

Functions to implement:
- get_annotations: Get annotations for a member
- add_annotation: Add annotation to a specific observation
- docs_for_smartplots: Provide documentation for smartplots

This service will handle all business logic related to annotations,
including data retrieval, creation, and storage.
